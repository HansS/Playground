ID3 Algorithm Decision Tree
==========                 

This is a C# implementation of the ID3 decision tree algorithm. It uses the shannon entropy to calcaulate the best feature split for a data set and builds a decision tree from the split sets.

It is tested against two UCI Machine learning data sets. One is for calculating contact lens hardness, the other is for evaluating the acceptability of a vehicle. Decision tree data sets can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
